## Introduction

### GitHub Pages Installation

To start using Jekyll right away with GitHub Pages, [fork the Millennial repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial/fork). From there, you can rename your repository to `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username, and edit the `settings.yml` file in the `_data` folder to your liking. Ensure that you have a branch named `gh-pages`. Your website should be ready immediately at 'http://USERNAME.github.io'. Note: if you are hosting several sites under the same GitHub username, then you will have to use [Project Pages instead of User Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) - just change the repository name to something other than 'http://USERNAME.github.io'.

Head over to the `_posts` directory to view all the posts that are currently on the website, and to see examples of what post files generally look like. You can simply just duplicate the template post and start adding your own content.

### Directory Structure

If you are familiar with Jekyll, then the Millennial directory structure shouldn't be too difficult to navigate. The following some highlights of the differences you might notice between the default directory structure. More information on what these folders and files do can be found in the [Jekyll documentation site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).

```bash
Millennial/
├── _data                      # Data files
|  └── settings.yml            # Theme settings and custom text
├── _includes                  # Theme includes
├── _layouts                   # Theme layouts (see below for details)
├── _posts                     # Where all your posts will go
├── assets                     # Style sheets and images are found here
|  ├── css                     # Style sheets go here
|  |  └── _sass                # Folder containing SCSS files
|  |  └── main.scss            # Main SCSS file
|  |  └── syntax.css           # Style sheet for code syntax highlighting
|  └── img                     # Images go here
├── pages                      # Category pages
├── _config.yml                # Site build settings
├── Gemfile                    # Ruby Gemfile for managing Jekyll plugins
├── index.md                   # Home page
├── LICENSE.md                 # License for this theme
├── README.md                  # Includes all of the documentation for this theme
└── rss-feed.xml               # Generates RSS 2.0 file which Jekyll points to
```

### Site Variables

To change site build settings, edit the `_config.yml` file found in the root of your repository, which you can tweak however you like. More information on configuration settings and plugins can be found on [the Jekyll documentation site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/). This is also where you will be able to customize the title, description, and the author/owner of your site.

If you are hosting your site on GitHub Pages, then committing a change to the `_config.yml` file will force a rebuild of your site with Jekyll. Any changes made should be viewable soon after. If you are hosting your site locally, then you must run `jekyll serve` again for the changes to take place.

In the `settings.yml` file found in the `_data` folder, you will be able to customize your site settings, such as setting Disqus comments, Google Analytics, what shows up in your menu, and social media information.

### Adding Menu Pages

The menu pages are found in the `menu` folder in the root directory, and can be added to your menu in the `settings.yml` file.

### Posts

You will find example posts in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit any post and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention of `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at any sample post to get an idea about how it works. If you already have a website built with Jekyll, simply copy over your posts to migrate to Millennial.

### Markdown

As always, Jekyll offers support for GitHub Flavored Markdown, which allows you to format your posts using the [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Examples of these text formatting features can be seen below. You can find this post in the `_posts` directory as well as the `README.md` file.

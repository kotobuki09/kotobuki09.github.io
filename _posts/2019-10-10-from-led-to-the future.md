# From LED to LiFi
The history of visible light communications (VLC) dates back to the 1880s in Washington, D.C., when the Scottish-born scientist Alexander Graham Bell invented the photophone, which transmitted speech on modulated sunlight over several hundred meters. This pre-dates the transmission of speech by radio. 

In Napoleon's time much of Europe was covered by a network of optical telegraphs called semaphores (not to be confused with the traffic lights found at today's road junctions), while Graham Bell believed his greatest invention was the photophone , a sort of telephone in which sound waves were transformed into electromagnetic waves of the visible or infrared spectrum instead of electrical impulses like its better known counterpart.

What do we have now and what can do in the future?
ENLIGHT’EM will train a new generation of innovators and provide them with the know-how to contribute to the development of the IoT in the world of 5G and beyond. Fifteen early stage researchers (ESRs) will evolve into leading-edge experts in a diverse array of sub-fields leading to the integration of low-energy VLC into the IoT. The ESRs will acquire and hone cutting-edge skills contributing to IoT areas such as connected energy, light, living and cities through a multidisciplinary network of experts from universities, research institutes, SMEs, and large companies.

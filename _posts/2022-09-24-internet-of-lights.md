## Internet of Light

This is a new poster that you can learn a little more about "light"

The data flow arriving from the network or from a LAN is encoded and modulated by software which translates them into high-frequency light pulses. To take the place of the emitting Wi-Fi antenna we find a LED lamp capable of emitting thousands of light pulses per second and thus guaranteeing data transmission.

At the other end of the wireless communication we find a receptor of light impulses (an optical sensor such as a camera), capable of detecting and decoding the signals transmitted by the LED, then sending them to a software that will process them and finally convert them into electrical signals that can be read by any computer or mobile device. 

In the future, the mobile with LiFi integrated should act as normal as wifi module.

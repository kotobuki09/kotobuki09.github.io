## Internet of Light

This is a new poster that you can learn a little more about "light"

The data flow arriving from the network or from a LAN is encoded and modulated by software which translates them into high-frequency light pulses. To take the place of the emitting Wi-Fi antenna we find a LED lamp capable of emitting thousands of light pulses per second and thus guaranteeing data transmission.

At the other end of the wireless communication we find a receptor of light impulses (an optical sensor such as a camera), capable of detecting and decoding the signals transmitted by the LED, then sending them to a software that will process them and finally convert them into electrical signals that can be read by any computer or mobile device.

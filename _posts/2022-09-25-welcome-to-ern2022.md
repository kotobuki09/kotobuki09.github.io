**SHARPER** is the name of one of the Italian projects supported by the European Commission for the realization of the European Researchers' Night in 2022 and 2023.

SHARPER means **SHAring Researchers' Passion for Enhanced Roadmaps** and aims to involve all citizens in discovering the profession of researcher and the role that researchers play in building the future of society through the investigation of the world based on facts, observations and the ability to adapt and interpret increasingly complex and constantly evolving social and cultural contexts.

SHARPER will take place on 30 September 2022 in the cities of **Ancona**, **Cagliari**, **Camerino**, **Catania**, **Genoa**, **L'Aquila**, **Macerata,** **Nuoro**, **Palermo**, **Pavia**, **Perugia**, **Sassari**, **Terni** and **Trieste** to tell the passion, the discoveries and the challenges of researchers from all over Europe through exhibitions, shows, concerts, games, conferences and hundreds of other initiatives aimed at the general public.

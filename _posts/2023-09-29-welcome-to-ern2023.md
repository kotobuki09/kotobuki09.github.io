**SHARPER** was the name of one of the Italian projects supported by the European Commission for the realization of the European Researchers' Night in 2022 and 2023.

SHARPER stood for **SHAring Researchers' Passion for Enhanced Roadmaps** and aimed to engage all citizens in discovering the profession of researcher and the role that researchers played in shaping the future of society through fact-based investigation, keen observations, and the ability to adapt and interpret increasingly complex and constantly evolving social and cultural contexts.

**SHARPER** took place on September 29, 2023, in the cities of **Ancona**, **Cagliari**, **Camerino**, **Catania**, **Genoa**, **L'Aquila**, **Macerata**, **Nuoro**, **Palermo**, **Pavia**, **Perugia**, **Sassari**, **Terni**, and **Trieste**. The event showcased the passion, discoveries, and challenges faced by researchers from all over Europe through exhibitions, performances, concerts, games, conferences, and hundreds of other activities aimed at engaging the general public.

Coordinated by the scientific communication company **Psiquadro**, SHARPER collaborated with a consortium that included the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (**INFN**), five universities (**Polytechnic University of Marche**, **University of Cagliari**, **University of Catania**, **University of Palermo**, and **University of Perugia**), the **Imaginary Scientific Museum of Trieste**, and the **Observa Science in Society** association. Additionally, the **University of Camerino**, the **University of Genova**, the **University of Macerata**, and the **University of Sassari** participated as associated partners.

With over 170 institutions, cultural partners, and research entities involved—including **CNR**, **INAF**, and **INGV**—SHARPER successfully reinvented more than 500 planned initiatives to ensure safe participation for citizens of all ages. The event was well-received and celebrated the contributions of researchers to society, fostering curiosity and appreciation for scientific research among attendees.
